### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Bruno Mansur from Brazil (). I've been a developer since 2001 and currently I've been working as a Tech Lead at [Sysmap](https://www.sysmap.com.br/). I'm passionate about open source projects and Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on one (ðŸ‘¯).

On free times I like to watch moovies, play instruments, play with my kids, listening podcasts and read books.
