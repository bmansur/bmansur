### Hi there 👋
I'm Bruno Mansur from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been a developer since 2001 and currently I've been working as a Tech Lead at [Sysmap](https://www.sysmap.com.br/). I'm passionate about open source projects and I’m looking to collaborate on one (👯).

On free times I like to watch moovies (🎞️), play acoustic guitar(🎸), play with my kids (🕹️), listening podcasts(🎧) and read books (📚).

Would you like to find me?
